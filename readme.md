### A fluid grid layout ###

#### How it works: ####

This grid system is a fluid 16-column grid system. It utilizes one or more columns inside of a row for a simple, clean grid-layout.

Structure your code in the following format:
`<div class="row">`
`	<div class="col span12">12</div>`
`	<div class="col span4">4</div>`
`</div>`

Definitions:
* The 'row' class needs to be added to the container element of the columns.
* The 'col' class should be added to the elements inside of the row container.
* The 'span[number]' classes are what size the columns. Pick a number, 1 - 16.

### To-do's ####
This project is still in it's infancy, so i'll be adding a lot more features. Right now it works, but it's pretty bare-bones.
* Add different layouts for smaller sizes.
* Enhance row-inside-of-row capabilities.
* Test in less modern browsers and make sure it works in the set I choose at that time.
